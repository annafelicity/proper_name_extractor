# Regex-based Proper-Name Extractor

One day, while working on a class project at General Assembly, I was looking for a proper name extractor to use for this project (https://github.com/annafelicity/FOIA_social_network_analysis_prototype), and I couldn't find one, so I decided to start to write one. I could find plenty of proper noun extractors, but nothing that really keyed in on people's names.

I've been fascinated by regex, and thought it might be a solid, if a bit cumbersome, way to pull the names out of strings. When I was a kid, I was captivated by cryptography (thanks Games Magazine), and between that and enjoying pattern-creation projects like making my own knitting patterns, it seemed a fun thing to attempt.

Here's where I've gotten so far. Feel free to contribute other regex patterns to add! Just name them in keeping with the existing naming system.
